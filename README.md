# MinecartChestFilter
## Storage Minecart ... with filters!
### Builds
You can obtain builds of each version from the [release page](https://github.com/Kory33/MinecartChestFilter/releases).

### Description
This plug-in introduces **filtered storage minecarts** to the Bukkit server. They can filter out (in other words, forbid players/hoppers to put) several types of items.

To spawn filtered storage minecarts, simply run `/spawnFilteredStorageMinecart`(alias: `/spawnfsminecart`) command in the game.
By default, this command is only available to the OP groups. Permissions to `filteredstorageminecart.*` may be granted if needed.

## TODOs

Log-in-time update notification  
In-game help command/detailed explanations
